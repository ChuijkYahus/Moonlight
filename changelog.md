added DynamicHolder, allows storing static fields to datapack registries entries, cleared automaticaly and re populated on datapack reload. Implements Holder and supplier interface.
DynamicHolders also are backed by a threadlocal cache so to work properly with datapack regisrie entry, unlike previus "DataObjectReference" which had issues.
