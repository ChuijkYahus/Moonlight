### UPDATED:
- **Ars Nouveau**: rolled back to the way it was like in v2.13.14
  - **NOTE:** WHY? The WoodTypes are all using the same planks & It created too many block variants. It's related to [Issue#267](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Moonlight/issues/267)
  There is no way to solve this.  
- **Ars Elemental**: will be excluded from now for the same reason as above

<span style='color: red;'>**WARNING:**</span> If you are using **EveryCompat**, then **BACKUP** your world before you update **Moonlight Lib**
